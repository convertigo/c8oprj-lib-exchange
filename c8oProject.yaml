    'This is the EWS (Exchange Web Service) Connector for Microsoft Exchange. This will work for Exchange On Line (Office365 Exchange Server) and for On Exchange On Prem installations.
    
    The Connector needs an Authentication to work. For Exchange One Line , you must use OAuth. A Simple Test app is provided to Show how to establish an OAuth Auth and then call the CreateExchangeSession Sequence.
    
    For On Prem Installations, you can use directly the  CreateExchangeSession Sequence by providing user and password.
